Mentors
=======

Code mentors are professional software developers with current industry
knowledge and demonstrate both the technical expertise, pedagogical skill and
people-management needed to be an effective code mentor. CodeGrades will favour
developers who actively contribute to free / open source projects. Becoming a
code mentor should be viewed as a special achievement.

As such, we imagine four levels of code mentor (initially, only the first two
will be used):

Apprentice Mentor
-----------------

Candidates who would like to become fully-fledged code
mentors but need to demonstrate the technical, pedagogical and
people-management skills needed to fulfil the role. While an apprentice
mentor we expect them to:

* Demonstrate the technical knowledge, experience and skill needed to fulfil
  their role as a code mentor. This should be presented as evidence in the form
  of code, community activity (talks, posters, group participation) and two
  references from other professional developers.
* Act as a teacher / facilitator for a group of learners
  who successfully complete the requirements of a grading under the tutelage of
  the apprentice mentor. This is to ensure the prospective code mentor has
  experience of CodeGrades from the learner's point of view and has a chance to
  practice the pedagogical and people skills needed to be an effective code
  mentor. Feedback from the learners will be sought to check the apprentice
  mentors suitability.

During this time the candidate will be subject to the checks required for
working with young people for their given locale (for example, in the UK we'd
use the `DBS <https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service>`_).

Code Mentor
-----------

These are the professional software developers who meet learners in the grading
process. They may, in addition, prepare learners for grading, although we'll
take every effort to ensure learners are graded by code mentors they don't
know. To be a code mentor means:

* You have the required criminal record checks for your locale in place (see
  the section on DBS above).
* You can give at least 1 week, but preferably 2 weeks of your time in each
  year to take part in grading. Such blocks of time don't have to be
  contiguous. Missing a week's block in a calendar year means removal from the
  register of code mentors.
* You are paid a competetive salary for your mentoring during grading
  (equivalent to a contractor day-rate in the mentor's locale).
* You have a page on the CodeGrades website so your status as a code mentor can
  be validated and, more importantly, celebrated and acknowledged.

Senior Code Mentor
------------------

A senior code mentor is someone employed full time by CodeGrades. They will
spend at least half their time working as a code mentor or associated tasks
(such as curriculum development, or supporting regular code mentors), with the
remaining 50% of their time being their own for the purposes of development of
free / open source software. How this time is split is negotiated on an
individual basis -- for example, working 2.5 days a week may suit some, whereas
others may want to work a month "on" followed by a month "off".

Distinguished Code Mentor
-------------------------

A distinguished code mentor is simply a senior code mentor who the wider
community of code mentors wish to recognise for their efforts, support or
contributions. We want to foster a positive community that recognises the
achievements of others.
