`Grade 1 </docs/2020/grades/1>`_: Simple Imperative Structure
=============================================================

When we write code, we are expressing a movement of thought so some useful
thing happens. First one thing happens, then another, and then another until
some we get a useful outcome. It is essential that beginner coders understand
how their code flows from one instruction to another. To this end, project code
should be:

* **Simple** - remove all superfluous code so only the code you need remains.
  More code means more potential for bugs. Simple code is also easier to
  understand and follow. Simple and straightforwad code demonstrates a clarity
  of thought and understanding.
* **Imperative** - make sure the statements in your code do only what you
  expect them to do. It should be obvious what your code does by reading your
  code (explain *why* your code does something via comments). Don't make your
  code do things you don't need it to.
* **Structure** - organise your code so it makes sense. Group related
  statements together and ensure the statements are ordered in the right
  way to produce the correct result. Use meaningful short names when assigning
  values so your code is easy to follow.

Do not try to be clever and use features of Python which may not be necessary
to solve the problem in hand. You get marks for **appropriate** code, not
code that shows you know about such-and-such a feature.

Most importantly, like learning to write, it takes practice to express yourself
in code, and we understand that grade 1 is your first step into this world.
