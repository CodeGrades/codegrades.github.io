`Grade 1 </docs/2020/grades/1>`_: Simple Arithmetic / Numeric Operators 
=======================================================================

In Python you can use familiar “operators” to perform basic arithmetic and
comparison of values. “Operator” is what we call the symbols used to represent
mathematical and logical operations which return new results. You already know
them as:

* ``+`` - addition, sum two numbers together. (``1 + 1`` returns ``2``)
* ``-`` - subtraction of one number from another. (``2 - 1`` returns ``1``)
* ``*`` - multiplication of one number by another. (``2 * 3`` returns ``6``)
* ``/`` - division of one number by another. (``5 / 2`` returns ``2.5``)
* ``%`` - modulo, give the remainder from a division. (``5 % 2`` returns ``1``)

Comparison operators always return a boolean value (either ``True`` or
``False``) depending on the comparison of two numbers:

* ``<`` - less than returns ``True`` if the number on the left is less than the
  number on the right. (``1 < 2`` returns ``True``)
* ``>`` - greater than returns ``True`` if the number on the left is greater
  than the number on the right. (``2 > 1`` returns ``True``)
* ``==`` - equals (not to be confused with assignment [``=``]) returns ``True``
  if two numbers are of the same value. (``2 == 2`` returns ``True``)
* ``!=`` - not equals returns ``True`` if the two numbers are NOT of the same
  value. (``2 != 1`` returns ``True``)
* ``<=`` - less than or equal to returns ``True`` if the number on the left is
  either less than or equal in value to the number on the right. (``2 <= 2``
  returns ``True``)
* ``>=`` - greater than or equal to returns ``True`` if the number on the left
  is either greater than or equal in value to the number on the right.
  (``2 >= 2`` returns ``True``)
