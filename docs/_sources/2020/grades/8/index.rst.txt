Python Programming - Grade 8 "Final" (2020)
==============================================

**This grade is valid until 30th June 2021.**

Prerequisites
-------------

Candidates should be familiar with the core concepts of Python covered in all
the previous grades.

Grade 8 is the final of the "enhanced" grades where the focus is upon
refining, deepening and practicing Python programming skills. While there are
fewer new concepts to cover in this grade they are more abstract and require a
depth of knowledge not encountered before.

In grade 8 candidates are required to write idiomatic Python and demonstrate
fluency and confidence in all the core concepts covered so far. A professional
level of care and attention is required about all aspects of the project and
code created for the grading. Not only will candidates appreciate an
appreciation of simplicity and readability in their code, they should be able
to discuss the Zen of Python and what it means. Candidates will also show
how they are autonomous learners who understand the importance of learning and
quickly digesting new technical solutions. Finally, they will demonstrate the
skill of supporting, explaining and collaborating with colleagues and
collaborators.

Candidates can use whatever coding environment they are familiar and most
comfortable with. To successfully complete the pair programming task, the
candidate's coding environment **must** allow them to use a debugger.

At this stage of development we expect candidates to be using "professional"
coding editors, tooling and development environments.

We do not accept projects presented with a block based programming environment.

Core Concepts
-------------

Candidates are expected to demonstrate knowledge and, where appropriate,
application of the following core concepts:

* `Magic Methods </docs/2020/grades/8/magic>`_ ~ understands what magic
  methods are, how they relate to Python protocols and are able to explain how
  these relate to the PEP process.
* `Packaging </docs/2020/grades/8/packaging>`_ ~ their project is appropriately
  packaged and appears on PyPI. Has an appreciation of the history of Python
  packaging and related ecosystem.
* `Anonymous Functions </docs/2020/grades/8/lambda>`_ ~ demonstrates a use of
  the ``lambda`` keyword and can explain what an anonymous function is and
  appropriate use cases.
* `Online Documentation </docs/2020/grades/8/docs>`_ ~ project documentation
  assets are published somewhere like ReadTheDocs.
* `Continuous Integration </docs/2020/grades/8/ci>`_ ~ there is an automated
  pipeline for project management (using techniques such as webhooks and GitHub
  integration with Travis or Appveyor to run test suites, packaging or create
  documentation).
* `Community Leadership and Mentoring </docs/2020/grades/8/mentor>`_ ~ shows
  evidence of mature, measured, humane and pragmatic leadership in their
  dealings with the wider community of users and developers. Demonstrates the
  development of pedagogical skill as an effective and supportive mentor to
  other developers.
* `The Zen of Python </docs/2020/grades/8/zen>`_ ~ not only can quote the Zen
  of Python, but `groks it <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok>`_.

Project
-------

Code mentors are expecting to see a project of some sophistication which
addresses a non-trivial problem, requirement or group of users. The project
will require evidence of depth of research, experimentation or user testing
and will be presented in a competent and well organised manner (for instance,
the project code is hosted online somewhere, and the documentation is
both comprehensive and well written).

Candidates are expected to demontrate self reflection and self evaluation
when it comes to explaining their high level approach, as well as describe
mistakes made, resulting adjustments and lessons learned. Of course, candidates
will have no problem with a technical "deep dive" analysis of a specific aspect
of their code in order to show their thinking about the implementation details
and coding decisions made when creating the feature in question.

The candidate will also very clearly signal and show evidence of the mature,
thoughtful and cooperative attitude needed to be an effective collaborator in
a complex software project.

Furthermore, either within their own project, or as a result of interacting
with other projects, the candidate demonstrates some skill and application of
mentorship -- helping others to flourish within the wider programming
community.

An example project at this level is TO BE DONE::

Take note that:

* It's fun and the creator has obviously thought about the users' needs.

Pairing Task
------------

At the enhanced level of grading candidates may encounter simple / trivial bugs
as characterised by the work done in foundation grades. Furthermore, they will
still be encouraged to revise and refactor code to enhance its capabilities or
make it easier to read, more efficient or more idiomatic. However, they will be
expected to add brand new features from scratch that appropriately fit within
the multi-file code base's structure, stylistic conventions and expectations of
code quality. For instance, their solution will include, if appropriate, unit
tests, comments and documentation.

Candidates will use a professional level coding environment, of their choice,
to engage with the code. They may also use scripts, Makefiles and other project
assets needed to fulfil code quality, test coverage or documentation related
requirements.

The project will include a comment describing the expected behaviour of the new
feature. This should be read **carefully** since it will contain details of
how the code should be updated.

The following is an example of the sort of project the candidate will
encounter::
