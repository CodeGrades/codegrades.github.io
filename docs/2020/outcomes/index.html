<p>CodeGrades has two broad aims:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>To bring about a technical culture that puts humans at its centre and
values creativity, playful experimentation and engineering excellence. We
will achieve this through the educational activities associated with taking
code grades (syllabus development, facilitating community based learning and
celebrating the success of participants).</li>
<li>To provide a secure means of funding for volunteer developers of
free / open-source software. This will be achieved via the mentorship
programme: developers may earn a living via mentorship activities.
Furthermore, if a project is a major part of or contributor of resources to
CodeGrades, they will receieve financial support for their continued
development and support.</li>
</ol>
<p>CodeGrades will be a for-profit company run for community benefit (where the
community are the learners and mentors).</p>
<div class="section" id="education-grades">
<h2>Education (Grades)<a class="headerlink" href="#education-grades" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Asking what sort of education we want is the same as asking what sort of
society we want, for it is through education that we transmit our culture,
knowledge and skill to the next generation. How we transmit our culture,
knowledge and skills is equally as important as the content since it also
reflects our culture.</p>
<p>CodeGrades are eight cumulative steps for learning the culture, knowledge and
skills needed to flourish as a software developer. They’re a programming
version of time-proven techniques like music grades, belts in martial arts and
lifeguard certification. They fill the gap between the copious amounts of
beginner material and professional level information.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/how-to-draw-an-owl.jpg" src="../../_images/how-to-draw-an-owl.jpg" />
<p>(All the introductory material is the equivalent of “draw two cirles”, places
like StackOverflow are like “draw the rest of the damn owl”, CodeGrades are
the eight missing steps in between.)</p>
<p>CodeGrades bring the knowledge, skills and current practices of a highly
experienced community of supportive developers within the reach of all learners
of all backgrounds. They provide learners with a clear and sustainable path
for growth, all within a supportive and relevant community.</p>
<p>How do they work?</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Learn and prepare a grading project at the right level.</li>
<li>Book an pay for a grading when you’re ready.</li>
<li>Present your project to a code mentor at your grading.</li>
<li>Get written feedback, support and advice to improve.</li>
<li>Goto 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Details of the specific requirements for each grade can be
<a class="reference external" href="/docs/2020/grades/">found in the section about grades</a>.</p>
<p>Grades cost between c£40-£120 (depending on level, a similar price to music
grades). All resources, tools, support, curriculum &amp; syllabus are free (the
costs being swallowed by grading fees).</p>
<p>If you can’t afford fees we’ll have a financial support / fee waiver programme
(for example, if you’re a young person in the UK who qualifies for free school
meals, your grading will be <em>free</em>). We’ll move mountains so grading is
available to everyone, no matter your situation.</p>
<p>Even if you took every grade at full price, the total cost would be a fraction
of what you’d pay for a coding bootcamp or classes (and we expect many will
skip grades if they make good progress).</p>

<div class="section" id="community-support-mentors">
<h2>Community Support (Mentors)<a class="headerlink" href="#community-support-mentors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Code mentors are experienced professional programmers who are at an advanced
enough level to demonstrate the exceptional technical, communication and
“people” skills needed to mentor effectively.</p>
<p>Becoming a mentor is a badge of honour: you’re helping (and paid) to nurture
your future colleagues, collaborators and users. Furthermore, it’s a public
acknowledgement that you have the technical and pedagogical skill to mentor
effectively. Finally, it’s fun career development!</p>
<p>Since CodeGrades is run for community benefit we especially welcome members of
the open-source community as mentors. It’s hard to be financially recognised
for your open-source work, and we hope mentoring is a way to help you support
your work.</p>
<p>Having said that, we’d welcome strong candidate mentors from all backgrounds
(especially if you identify as coming from an under-represented group in tech).
We simply expect you to demonstrate the technical strength, communication
skills and compassion as a people-person.</p>
<p>Finally, mentors (since they are experienced professional programmers) are a
source of feedback for the future development of the resources, curriculum and
syllabus (along with teachers and learners).</p>
