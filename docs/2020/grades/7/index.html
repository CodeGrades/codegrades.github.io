<h1>Python Programming - Grade 7 “Advanced” (2020)<a class="headerlink" href="#python-programming-grade-7-advanced-2020" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>This grade is valid until 30th June 2021.</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="prerequisites">
<h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Candidates should be familiar with the core concepts of Python covered in all
the previous grades.</p>
<p>Grade 7 is the second of the “enhanced” grades where the focus is upon
refining, deepening and practicing Python programming skills. While there are
fewer new concepts to cover in this grade they are more abstract and require a
depth of knowledge not encountered before. Several concepts from the core
grades will be revisited in more detail.</p>
<p>In grade 7 candidates are required to write idiomatic Python and demonstrate
fluency and confidence in all the core concepts covered so far. Not only should
this apply to individual core concepts, but the candidate should be able to
apply or use several concepts which complement each other when addressing a
particular problem or situation. Candidates should also demonstrate an
appreciation of simplicity and readability in their code.</p>
<p>Candidates can use whatever coding environment they are familiar and most
comfortable with. To successfully complete the pair programming task, the
candidate’s coding environment <strong>must</strong> allow them to use a debugger.</p>
<p>At this stage of development we expect candidates to be using “professional”
coding editors, tooling and development environments.</p>
<p>We do not accept projects presented with a block based programming environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="core-concepts">
<h2>Core Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#core-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Candidates are expected to demonstrate knowledge and, where appropriate,
application of the following core concepts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="/docs/2020/grades/7/concurrency">Concurrency</a> ~ understands simple use
of threading, multiprocessing and asyncio. Can explain basic/core concepts
underlying such language features: blocking vs non-blocking code, event
driven programming, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">async</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">await</span></code> keywords, coroutines.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/docs/2020/grades/7/networking">Networking</a> ~ understands simple use of
sockets for network programming. Is able to describe the use cases for
different networking protocols in the network stack (e.g. HTTP, TCP/IP, UDP,
SMTP).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/docs/2020/grades/7/ui">User Interfaces</a> ~ demonstrates an understanding
of at least one means of creating a user interface in Python: via a web
page (including HTML forms) or a GUI toolkit such as Qt, GTK or tkinter.
Evidence of basic user experience heuristics should be in evidence, as well
as knowledge of accessibility related considerations.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/docs/2020/grades/7/mocking">Mocking</a> ~ knowledge and use of
appropriate use of mocking and patching in test suites. Is able to explain
some of the benefits and pitfalls of such an approach to demonstrate an
appreciation of the subtleties involved in this approach.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/docs/2020/grades/7/strategies">Test strategies</a> ~ is able to explain
different types of test strategy (for example, the difference between unit
and integration tests), and how such tests may be implemented or run with
tools such as PyTest, the built-in unittest module or Selenium.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/docs/2020/grades/7/projects">Project Automation</a> ~ is able to show how
common tasks associated with their project have been automated with, for
example, a Makefile or similar approach (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">test</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">docs</span></code> etc).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/docs/2020/grades/7/community">Community Collaboration</a> ~ demonstrates an
understanding of the collaborative and open behaviour expected for positive
contributions to a FLOSS community. This includes a level of ethical
conduct including, but not limited to, thanking people, taking part in
respectful technical and community discussions, acknowledging and celebrating
the work and achievements of others.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project">
<h2>Project<a class="headerlink" href="#project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Code mentors are expecting to see a project of some sophistication which
addresses a non-trivial problem, requirement or group of users. The project
will require evidence of depth of research, experimentation or user testing
and will be presented in a competent and well organised manner (for instance,
the project code is hosted online somewhere, and the documentation is
both comprehensive and well written).</p>
<p>Candidates are expected to demontrate self reflection and self evaluation
when it comes to explaining their high level approach, as well as describe
mistakes made, resulting adjustments and lessons learned. Of course, candidates
will have no problem with a technical “deep dive” analysis of a specific aspect
of their code in order to show their thinking about the implementation details
and coding decisions made when creating the feature in question.</p>
<p>The candidate will also very clearly signal and show evidence of the mature,
thoughtful and cooperative attitude needed to be an effective collaborator in
a complex software project.</p>
<p>An example project at this level is TO BE DONE:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># LINK TO PROJECT</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Take note that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It’s fun and the creator has obviously thought about the users’ needs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pairing-task">
<h2>Pairing Task<a class="headerlink" href="#pairing-task" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the enhanced level of grading candidates may encounter simple / trivial bugs
as characterised by the work done in foundation grades. Furthermore, they will
still be encouraged to revise and refactor code to enhance its capabilities or
make it easier to read, more efficient or more idiomatic. However, they will be
expected to add brand new features from scratch that appropriately fit within
the multi-file code base’s structure, stylistic conventions and expectations of
code quality. For instance, their solution will include, if appropriate, unit
tests, comments and documentation.</p>
<p>Candidates will use a professional level coding environment, of their choice,
to engage with the code. They may also use scripts, Makefiles and other project
assets needed to fulfil code quality, test coverage or documentation related
requirements.</p>
<p>The project will include a comment describing the expected behaviour of the new
feature. This should be read <strong>carefully</strong> since it will contain details of
how the code should be updated.</p>
<p>The following is an example of the sort of project the candidate will
encounter:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Example TO BE DONE</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Take note that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>COMMENTARY TO BE DONE.</li>
</ul>
</div>
