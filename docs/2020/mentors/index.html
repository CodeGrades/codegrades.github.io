<p>“Code mentor” is the friendly name we use instead of “examiner”.</p>
<div class="section" id="what">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">What?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#what" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The primary role of the code mentor is to assess candidates by providing
structured, supportive, positively framed yet honest and actionable feedback
and critique on projects and pair programming tasks presented as part of the
grading process.</p>
<p>Code mentors are paid for their time fulfilling this role. Candidates pay to
take a grade, part of which goes to the mentor with the rest going to
CodeGrades for two purposes: to pay for running CodeGrades and as a pool of
money to support FLOSS projects, communities and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Code mentors may also be involved in fostering learning and study
groups in the wider community and will also be invited to take part in
writing / revising the CodeGrades syllabus. Again, CodeGrades will financially
support such endeavours (under the “supporting FLOSS” banner).</p>
<p>To be very clear, in addition to the educational aims of CodeGrades, another
important aim is to become financially sustainable to be able to support and
grow FLOSS projects and invest in <strong>individuals</strong> who both mentor and
contribute to the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Who?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#who" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Code mentors are professional software developers with current industry
knowledge and who demonstrate technical expertise, pedagogical skill and
supportive professionalism. CodeGrades will favour developers who actively
contribute to free / open source projects.</p>
<p>Becoming a code mentor should be viewed as a special achievement, something to
put on a CV and which folks may eventually aspire to as a career goal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, should the CodeGrades experiment succeed, becoming a code mentor
also means joining a professional support network of other folks who share a
similar desire for personal development through supporting others in learning
to write code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">How?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#how" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since CodeGrades is bootstrapping, becoming a CodeMentor will initially be
an ad hoc “invite” based system which will include some provision of training
concerning the processes, assessment criteria and expectations involved in
taking part in a grading as a code mentor.</p>
<p>Eventually, becoming a code mentor will be a well trodden path, encompassing
carefully planned training based upon experience and reflections gained during
the bootstrapping phase.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we imagine four types of code mentor:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Apprentice mentor (someone learning to become a code mentor).</li>
<li>Code mentor (fulfilling and being paid for participation in grading described
above).</li>
<li>Tenured mentor (the same as a code mentor, but employed full-time by
CodeGrades and entailing further duties as part of their role as an employee
of CodeGrades – if the experiment ever gets that far).</li>
<li>Distinguished mentor (a mentor recognised with such a title by their fellow
code mentors as a mark of respect for their efforts, support or
contributions to CodeGrades).</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to foster a positive community that recognises and cherishes the
achievements of others - and having non-hierarchical types of mentor (defined
in terms of <em>personal investment in the role of code mentor</em>) is one such
mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Why?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#why" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Code mentors fulfil three needs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>They are trusted role models for beginner programmers. In this sense a code
mentor is promoting a certain programming culture and expectations of
behaviour.</li>
<li>By taking and achieving a grade a candidate is going through an initiation
into the “next level”. The code mentor is the “wise elder” figure whose word
makes this happen. This is primarily to help address impostor syndrome: there
is evidence that an expert thinks you (the candidate) have attained the
skills and knowledge for “grade 5 Python” (for example). The validation comes
from a respected source of authority external to the candidate.</li>
<li>A code mentor applies their considerable technical skill and knowledge in
such a way to give meaningful feedback, constructive critique and actionable
suggestions relating to the evidence of attainment of candidates at different
levels of grading. The marking scheme allows mentors to indicate where
strengths and weaknesses may be for various attributes of coding attainment,
and also includes sections for <em>guided written feedback</em> so mentors express
specific feedback, support and advice relating to the individual candidate
(a draft assessment form can be <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdzcWhB3NJLQF88h9w18lqizrwmY5QdG-O_B7qW02c4HtM0Lw/viewform">found here</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>It may also be helpful to explicitly state that the grading assessment is NOT
a case of “I’ve reached level 42 in the Numberwang scale”. Like a GPA or SAT
score, this is meaningless, arbitrary and culturally toxic (the focus becomes
the level, rather than what it takes to achieve such a level).</p>
<p>Rather, grading assessment involves marks and statements to describe levels of
attainment for specific attributes, along with personalised written feedback.
The end result is meant to be a useful indication of strengths, weaknesses and
an acknowledgement of accomplishments and potential for future growth.</p>
