              information.</p>
              <h3>Data protection principles</h3>
              <p>We will comply with data protection law. This says that the
              personal information we hold about you must be:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way.</li>
                <li>Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly
                explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible
                with those purposes.</li>
                <li>Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited
                only to those purposes.</li>    
                <li>Accurate and kept up to date.</li>  
                <li>Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have
                told you about.</li>    
                <li>Kept securely.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>We will collect, store, and use the following categories of
              personal information about you:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Email Address</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>How is your personal information collected?</h3>
              <p>We collect personal information about everyone through use of
              this website and it's forms.</p>
              <h3>How we will use information about you</h3>
              <p>We will only use your personal information when the law allows
              us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal information in
              the following circumstances:</p><ol>
                <li>Where we need to perform a contract we have entered into
                with you.</li>
                <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or
                those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental
                rights do not override those interests.</li>
                <li>Where you have given a freely given, specific, informed and
                unambiguous consent to the processing of your personal
                information for one or more specific purposes.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>We may also use your personal information in the following
              situations, which are likely to be rare:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else's
                interests).</li>
                <li>Where it is needed in the public interest or for official
                purposes.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Situations in which we will use your personal information</h3>
              <p>We will only process your personal information for the
              following purposes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>To respond to your contact form.</li>
                <li>Processing anonymised statistical analysis of the traffic
                on this website, for the purpose of ensuring stability and
                availability of the services we offer to contracted
                clients</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and
              there may be several grounds which justify our use of your
              personal information.</p>
              <h3>If you fail to provide personal information</h3>
              <p>If you fail to provide certain information when requested, we
              may not be able to contact you.</p>
              <h3>Change of purpose</h3>
              <p>We will only use your personal information for the purposes
              for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we
              need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible
              with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal
              information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we
              will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
              <p>Please note that we may process your personal information
              without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above
              rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
              <h3>Do we need your consent?</h3>
              <p>We may approach you for your written consent to allow us to
              process certain particularly sensitive personal data. If we do
              so, we will provide you with full details of the information that
              we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can
              carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be
              aware that, in accordance with our written policy document, there
              are circumstances permitted by law where we may use particularly
              sensitive personal data without you consent.</p>
              <h3>Automated decision-making</h3>
              <p>Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic
              system uses personal information to make a decision without human
              intervention. We are allowed to use automated decision-making in
              the following circumstances:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Where we have notified you of the decision and given you 21
                days to request a reconsideration.</li>
                <li>In limited circumstances, with your explicit written
                consent and where appropriate measures are in place to
                safeguard your rights.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>If we make an automated decision on the basis of any
              particularly sensitive personal information, we must have either
              your explicit written consent or it must be justified in the
              public interest, and we must also put in place appropriate
              measures to safeguard your rights.</p>
              <p>You will not be subject to decisions that will have a
              significant impact on you based solely on automated
              decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and
              we have notified you.</p>
              <h3>Data sharing</h3>
              <p>We may have to share your data with third parties, including
              third-party service providers and other entities in the
              group.</p>
              <p>We require third parties to respect the security of your data
              and to treat it in accordance with the law.</p>
              <p>We may transfer your personal information outside the EU.</p>
              <p>If we do, you can expect a similar degree of protection in
              respect of your personal information.</p>
              <h4>Why might you share my personal information with third
              parties?</h4>
              <p>We will share your personal information with third parties
              where required by law, where it is necessary to administer the
              online relationship with you or where we have another legitimate
              interest in doing so.</p>
              <h4>Which third-party service providers process my personal
              information?</h4>
              <p>"Third parties" includes third-party service providers
              (including contractors and designated agents) and other entities
              within our group. The following third-party service providers
              process personal information about you for the following
              purposes: storage of your information, communicating with you,
              processing your communications and requests.</p>
              <h4>How secure is my information with third-party service
              providers and other entities in our group?</h4>
              <p>All our third-party service providers and other entities in
              the group are required to take appropriate security measures to
              protect your personal information in line with our policies. We
              do not allow our third-party service providers to use your
              personal data for their own purposes. We only permit them to
              process your personal data for specified purposes and in
              accordance with our instructions.</p>
              <h4>When might you share my personal information with other
              entities in the group?</h4>
              <p>We may share your personal information with other third
              parties, for example in the context of needing to share your
              personal information with a regulator or to otherwise comply
              with the law.</p>
              <h3>Data security</h3>
              <p>We have put in place measures to protect the security of your
              information. Details of these measures are available upon
              request. Third parties will only process your personal
              information on our instructions and where they have agreed to
              treat the information confidentially and to keep it secure.</p>
              <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent
              your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or
              accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In
              addition, we limit access to your personal information to those
              employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a
              business need to know. They will only process your personal
              information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
              confidentiality. Details of these measures may be obtained from
              our Data Protection Officer.</p>
              <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected
              data security breach and will notify you and any applicable
              regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to
              do so.</p>
              <h3>Data retention</h3>
              <h4>How long will you use my information for?</h4>
              <p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as
              necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including
              for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or
              reporting requirements. Details of retention periods for
              different aspects of your personal information are available in
              our retention policy which is available from our Data Protection
              Officer. To determine the appropriate retention period for
              personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of
              the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised
              use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which
              we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
              purposes through other means, and the applicable legal
              requirements.</p>
              <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal
              information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in
              which case we may use such information without further notice to
              you. We will retain and securely destroy your personal
              information in accordance with our data retention policy and/or
              applicable laws and regulations.</p>
              <h3>Rights of access, correction, erasure, and restriction</h3>
              <h4>Your duty to inform us of changes</h4>
              <p>It is important that the personal information we hold about
              you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your
              personal information changes during your working relationship
              with us.</p>
              <h4>Your rights in connection with personal information</h4>
              <p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Request access to your personal information (commonly known
                as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to
                receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you
                and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
                <li>Request correction of the personal information that we hold
                about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or
                inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>
                <li>Request erasure of your personal information. This enables
                you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where
                there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You
                also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal
                information where you have exercised your right to object to
                processing (see below).</li>
                <li>Object to processing of your personal information where we
                are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third
                party) and there is something about your particular situation
                which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
                You also have the right to object where we are processing your
                personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
                <li>Request the restriction of processing of your personal
                information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
                processing of personal information about you, for example if
                you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for
                processing it.</li>
                <li>Request the transfer of your personal information to
                another party.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of
              your personal information, object to the processing of your
              personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your
              personal information to another party, please contact <a href="mailto:mailto:hello@codegrades.com">hello@codegrades.com</a> in writing.</p>
              <h4>No fee usually required</h4>
              <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal
              information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However,
              we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is
              clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to
              comply with the request in such circumstances.</p>
              <h4>What we may need from you</h4>
              <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help
              us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the
              information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is
              another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal
              information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to
              receive it.</p>
              <h4>Right to withdraw consent</h4>
              <p>In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your
              consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your
              personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right
              to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any
              time. To withdraw your consent, please contact
              <a href="mailto:mailto:hello@codegrades.com">hello@codegrades.com</a>.
              Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your
              consent, we will no longer process your information for the
              purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have
              another legitimate basis for doing so in law.</p>
              <h4>Data protection officer</h4>
              <p>We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) to oversee
              compliance with this privacy notice. If you have any questions
              about this privacy notice or how we handle your personal
              information, please contact the DPO. You have the right to make a

              (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection
              issues.</p>
              <h4>Changes to this privacy notice</h4>
              <p>We reserve the right to update this privacy notice at any
              time, and we will provide you with a new privacy notice when we
              make any substantial updates. We may also notify you in other
              ways from time to time about the processing of your personal
              information.</p>
