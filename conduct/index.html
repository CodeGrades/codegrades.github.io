                <p>The CodeGrades community is made up of members from around
                the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and
                experiences. It is through these differences that our community
                experiences great successes and continued growth. When you're
                working with members of the community, we expect you to
                follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and
                strive to keep CodeGrades a positive, successful, and growing
                community.</p>

                <p>A member of the CodeGrades community is:</p>

                <h3>Open</h3>

                <p>Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether
                it's on code, projects, problems, or otherwise. We're receptive
                to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences and
                skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our
                efforts. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our
                activities, fostering an environment where anyone can
                participate and everyone can make a difference.</p>

                <h3>Considerate</h3>

                <p>Members of the community are considerate of their peers --
                other CodeGrades users, learners and mentors. We're thoughtful
                when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that
                often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the
                community. We're attentive in our communications, whether in
                person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing
                views.</p>

                <h3>Respectful</h3>

                <p>Members of the community are respectful. We're respectful of
                others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and
                their efforts. We're respectful of the efforts of others that
                permeate the CodeGrades community. We're respectful of the
                processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
                When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.</p>

                <p>Overall, we're good to each other. We contribute to this
                community not because we have to, but because we want to. If we
                remember that, these guidelines will come naturally.</p>
