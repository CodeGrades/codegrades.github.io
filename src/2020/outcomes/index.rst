CodeGrades has two broad aims:

1. To bring about a technical culture that puts humans at its centre and 
   values creativity, playful experimentation and the constant cultivation of
   technical skill. We will achieve this through the educational activities
   associated with taking code grades (syllabus development, facilitating
   community based learning and celebrating the success of participants).

2. To provide a secure means of funding for volunteer developers of
   free / open-source software. This will be achieved via the mentorship
   programme where developers earn money for mentorship activities.
   Furthermore, if a project is a major part of or contributor of resources to
   CodeGrades, they will receieve financial support for their continued
   development and support.

CodeGrades will be a for-profit company run for community benefit (where the
community are the learners and mentors).

Education (Grades)
------------------

Asking what sort of education we want is the same as asking what sort of
society we want, for it is through education that we transmit our culture,
knowledge and skill to the next generation. How we transmit our culture,
knowledge and skills is equally as important as the content since it also
reflects our culture.

CodeGrades are eight cumulative steps for learning the culture, knowledge and
skills needed to flourish as a software developer. They're a programming
version of time-proven techniques like music grades, belts in martial arts and
lifeguard certification. They fill the gap between the copious amounts of
beginner material and professional level information.

(All the introductory material is the equivalent of "draw two cirles", places
like StackOverflow are like "draw the rest of the damn owl", CodeGrades are
the eight missing steps in between.)

CodeGrades bring the knowledge, skills and current practices of a highly
experienced community of supportive developers within the reach of learners
of all backgrounds. They provide learners with a clear and sustainable path
for growth, all within a supportive and relevant community.

How does it work?

1. Learn and prepare a grading project at the next appropriate level.
2. Book and pay for the grading when ready.
3. Take part in a grading with a code mentor:

   a. Present the project.
   b. Pair program with the mentor on previously unseen code.

4. Get written feedback, support and advice to improve.
5. Goto 1.

Details of the specific requirements for each grade can be
`found in the section about grades </docs/2020/grades/>`_.

Grades cost between c£80-£200 (depending on level, a similar price to music
grades). All resources, tools, support, curriculum & syllabus are free (the
costs being swallowed by grading fees).

Prices will be reduced for full-time students. There will be a financial
support / fee waiver programme in place (for example, a young person in the UK
who qualifies for free school meals, or a working age person in the UK claiming
universal credit will qualify for *free* or much reduced grading costs). The
important point is CodeGrades will move mountains so grading is available to
everyone, no matter the financial context.

Even if every grade was taken at full price, the total cost would be a fraction
of what the cost of a coding bootcamp or classes (and we expect many will
skip grades if they make good progress -- it's not mandatory to take all the
previous grades before the one being taken).

Community Support (Mentors)
---------------------------

Code mentors are experienced professional programmers who are at a stage in
their career and professional and personal development where they are able to
demonstrate the exceptional technical, social and pedagogical skills needed to
mentor effectively.

Becoming a mentor is a badge of merit that indicates a person is recognised as
having the attributes of a highly effective and positive member of the software
development community; to the extent that they are both giving back to the
community (through mentorship activity) and *humbly* assuming the mantle of
role model for the sort of moral, professional and technical behaviour
condusive to a robust, respectful, diverse and dynamic community of coders.

The primary task of a mentor is to assess candidates at a grading. In doing so,
they engage with, help (and are paid) to support their future colleagues,
collaborators and users.

In addition to financial reward and professional recognition, becoming a code
mentor comes with other benefits: it's a fun path for career development (for
instance, the attributes of a mentor involved in grading are also really useful
to re-apply in the world of software development; being a code mentor is an
opportunity to explore, develop and reflect upon such important skills).
Furthermore, the wider body of code mentors is a latent pool of potential
mutual professional support and networking which CodeGrades will want to
foster, enable and nourish.

Since CodeGrades is run for community benefit we especially welcome members of
the open-source community as mentors. It's hard to be financially recognised
for open-source work, and mentoring is a way to help developers, who show
leadership, skill and supportive professionalism, support their work.

Having said that, CodeGrades would welcome strong candidate mentors from all
backgrounds (especially if they identify as coming from an under-represented
group in tech).

Finally, mentors (since they are experienced professional programmers) are a
source of feedback for the future development of the resources, curriculum and
syllabus (along with teachers and learners). The key is finding and putting
energy into self-reinforcing virtuous circles.
