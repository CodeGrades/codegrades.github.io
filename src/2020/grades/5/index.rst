Python Programming - Grade 5 "Higher" (2020)
==================================================

**This grade is valid until 30th June 2021.**

Prerequisites
-------------

Grade 5 completes the core category of grades. By passing this grade candidates
will have demonstrated they understand and make use of the core concepts of
Python at a basic level. As with grade 4, candidates will have an opportunity
to further explore how the core skills and knowledge fit together and make a
coherent whole. Passing grade 5 also gives candidates a solid foundation from
which to build expertise and practice skill in the final grades.

In grade 5 candidates must to show fluency, depth of knowledge and
confidence at integrating the core skills, concepts and practices covered so
far. Not only should they be familiar with all the core concepts
needed to flourish in the previous grades, but they show clear evidence of an
appreciation of how they complement each other.

Candidates can use whatever coding environment they are familiar and most
comfortable with. This may include the
`Mu Python code editor <https://codewith.mu/>`_, although by this level of
grading we want to see candidates transitioning to "professional" development
tools. To successfully complete the pair programming task, the candidate's
coding environment **must** allow them to use a debugger.

We do not accept projects presented with a block based programming environment.

Core Concepts
-------------

Candidates are expected to demonstrate knowledge and, where appropriate,
application of the following core concepts:

* `Basic Object Orientation </docs/2020/grades/5/oop>`_ ~ candidates create and
  instantiate their own classes, understand the purpose and usage of of
  ``__init__``, what ``self`` refers to, can explain the difference between an
  attribute and method while also showing appropriate use of classes and
  objects within their own code.
* `Data serialisation </docs/2020/grades/5/serialisation>`_ ~ familiarity with
  JSON and CSV data serialisation along with the related modules in the
  standard library. Is able to explain the different use cases for each
  standard (unstructured vs tabular/structured data).
* `Context handlers </docs/2020/grades/5/context>`_ ~ understands the correct
  use of the ``with`` statement and is able to explain the reasons for using it
  with certain sorts of objects and in certain sorts of situations, while also
  giving concrete examples of such use (such as for managing the lifecycle of
  an open file).
* `Truth and Logic </docs/2020/grades/5/logic>`_ ~ an appreciation of idiomatic
  use of truth (empty collections evaluate as ``False``) and related operators
  within a wider coding context.
* `Logging </docs/2020/grades/5/logging>`_ ~ familiarity with the basic use
  and configuration of the logging module. Understands how to configure the
  formatting of log files. Appreciates the different logging levels and their
  expected use.
* `Virtualenv and PIP </docs/2020/grades/5/virtualenv>`_ ~ is able to use
  and explain the purpose of a virtualenv. Is able to install and remove
  Python packages with the ``pip`` command. Understands the significance of
  requirements.txt and how to use it to install all the packages needed for
  a working development environment.
* `Code quality </docs/2020/grades/5/quality>`_ ~ familiarity with various
  sorts of code quality related tooling: pycodestyle (for PEP8 style checking),
  pyflakes (for code analysis) and black (for code layout).
* `Sphinx Documentation </docs/2020/grades/5/docs>`_ ~ the project's
  documentation is within a ``doc`` directory and under the control of
  Sphinx. They understand basic RST or Markdown and the resulting documentation
  is well structured, clear, contains unambigous examples and is comprehensive.


Project
-------

Since grade 5 completes to core category of grades, code mentors will expect
candidates to show an appropriate breadth of knowledge of all the core concepts
covered so far with particular focus on the candidate's judgement and
evaluation of how such concepts work together to create simple, effective and
well maintained code. In other words, the core concepts covered so far have
been integrated by the candidate, into a coherent and effective model of how
different language features work and relate to each other. At this stage, the
notion of "Pythonic" is not just implied, but explicit in the way the candidate
explains how their code works and is expressed.

An example project at this level is TO BE COMPLETED::

   # LINK TO CODE. 

Take note that:

* It's fun and the creator has obviously thought about the users' needs.

Pairing Task
------------

The task is presented in such a way to encourage the candidate to
revise the code to add a new feature or capabilities and to refactor the code
so it becomes easier to read, more efficient or more idiomatic.

At grade 5 the unseen code WILL include core concepts up to and including
those for grade five -- presented in such a way that an appreciation of how
such concepts work together needs to be applied in order to refactor and/or
revise the code..

We also need to see evidence of competence using their coding environment of
choice. At this level we expect to see them make appropriate use of the REPL
and debugger.

The candidate should be moving away from beginner focused tools and make use of
a coding environment of their choice to engage with the unseen fragment of
code. The code will start with a comment describing the expected behaviour of
the script. This should be read **carefully** since it will contain details of
how the code should be enhanced.

The following is an example of the sort of script the candidate will
encounter::

* COMMENTARY TO BE DONE.
