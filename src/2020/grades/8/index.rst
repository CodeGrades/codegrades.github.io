Python Programming - Grade 8 "Final" (2020)
==============================================

**This grade is valid until 30th June 2021.**

Prerequisites
-------------

Candidates should be familiar with the core concepts of Python covered in all
the previous grades.

Grade 8 is the final of the "enhanced" grades where the focus is upon
refining, deepening and practicing Python programming skills. While there are
fewer new concepts to cover in this grade they are more abstract and require a
depth of knowledge not encountered before.

In grade 8 candidates are required to write idiomatic Python and demonstrate
fluency and confidence in all the core concepts covered so far. A professional
level of care and attention is required about all aspects of the project and
code created for the grading. Not only will candidates appreciate an
appreciation of simplicity and readability in their code, they should be able
to discuss the Zen of Python and what it means. Candidates will also show
how they are autonomous learners who understand the importance of learning and
quickly digesting new technical solutions. Finally, they will demonstrate the
skill of supporting, explaining and collaborating with colleagues and
collaborators.

Candidates can use whatever coding environment they are familiar and most
comfortable with. To successfully complete the pair programming task, the
candidate's coding environment **must** allow them to use a debugger.

At this stage of development we expect candidates to be using "professional"
coding editors, tooling and development environments.

We do not accept projects presented with a block based programming environment.

Core Concepts
-------------

Candidates are expected to demonstrate knowledge and, where appropriate,
application of the following core concepts:

* `Magic Methods </docs/2020/grades/8/magic>`_ ~ understands what magic
  methods are, how they relate to Python protocols and are able to explain how
  these relate to the PEP process.
* `Packaging </docs/2020/grades/8/packaging>`_ ~ their project is appropriately
  packaged and appears on PyPI. Has an appreciation of the history of Python
  packaging and related ecosystem.
* `Anonymous Functions </docs/2020/grades/8/lambda>`_ ~ demonstrates a use of
  the ``lambda`` keyword and can explain what an anonymous function is and
  appropriate use cases.
* `Online Documentation </docs/2020/grades/8/docs>`_ ~ project documentation
  assets are published somewhere like ReadTheDocs.
* `Continuous Integration </docs/2020/grades/8/ci>`_ ~ there is an automated
  pipeline for project management (using techniques such as webhooks and GitHub
  integration with Travis or Appveyor to run test suites, packaging or create
  documentation).
* `Community Leadership and Mentoring </docs/2020/grades/8/mentor>`_ ~ shows
  evidence of mature, measured, humane and pragmatic leadership in their
  dealings with the wider community of users and developers. Demonstrates the
  development of pedagogical skill as an effective and supportive mentor to
  other developers.
* `The Zen of Python </docs/2020/grades/8/zen>`_ ~ not only can quote the Zen
  of Python, but `groks it <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok>`_.

Project
-------

At this stage code mentors expect candidates to show an appreciation of
idiomatic Python. Furthermore candidates are expected to show reflection and
judgement about the way they have chosen to implement their project (why did
they choose this approach, rather than another?).

An example project at this level is the following text based "Adventure Game"::

   # Simple adventure game. 

Take note that:

* It's fun and the creator has obviously thought about the users' needs.

Pairing Task
------------

The pairing task in grade 3 may include bugs as encountered in grades 1 and 2.
However, the task is presented in such a way to encourage the candidate to
revise the code to add a new feature or capabilities and to refactor the code
so it becomes easier to read, more efficient or more idiomatic.

We also need to see evidence of competence using their coding environment of
choice. At this level we expect to see them make appropriate use of the REPL
and debugger.

The candidate could use the `Mu Python code editor <https://codewith.mu/>`_ or
a coding environment of their choice to engage with the unseen fragment of
code. The code will start with a comment describing the expected behaviour of
the script. This should be read **carefully** since it will contain details of
how the code should be enhanced.

The following is an example of the sort of script the candidate will
encounter::

    # Example

Take note that:

* The fragment is very short and simple (only thirteen lines of actual Python
  -- if you discard comments and the fact that the list is over several lines).
